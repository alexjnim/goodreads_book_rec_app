# Data
The raw data for this project has been included in the data folder, however, the source location can be found [here](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k).

# Files and File Structure Details
- data/ : this contains the base data used to build the similarity matrix 
- resources/ : this contains all the classes and functions used in the application
- static/ : this contains all the CSS and JavaScript code required to render the frontend. 
- templates/ : this contains the frontend HTML

The following files were written for the purpose of deploying the API on Heroku's server. 
- requirements.txt : this contains all the python libraries that need to be installed in order to run the app
- runtime.txt : this tells Heroku the version of Python you are using
- Procfile : this will give instructions to Heroku to run the app using gunicorn

# run flask app

```
cd app

source app_env/bin/activate

flask run
```


# build docker container

```shell
cd app

# login to dockerhub
docker login

# build image
docker build -t alexnimjli/book_rec_flask_app .

# run image as container
docker run <imageID>

# see available containers
docker ps
# enter container
docker exec -it <containerID> bash

# push to dockerhub
docker push alexnimjli/book_rec_flask_app
```

# run service via docker-compose

```shell
docker-compose up
# now open localhost:80

# exit
docker-compose down
```
# run service via minikube

``` shell
minikube start

# now in another terminal
cd kubernetes

kubectl apply -f .

# now back to the minikube terminal
# get service url
minikube service <service_name> --url
